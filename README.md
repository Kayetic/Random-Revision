# Random-Revision 🎲

Welcome to the repo of Random-Revision! 👋

It is a simple website that gives me a random A-Level topic to revise... and that's it 🎲

"But why?" you may ask.

Ever been struck by the paradox of choice? 🤔 You come home, ready to revise 📚, all mentally prepared, you have everything ready, you finally sit down...and you don't know what to revise - too many topics, too little time!

You loose all motivation and start getting distracted, learning disrupted. 👀

Hence why I made this website - in the book "Atomic Habits", the author James Clear shows that often the simplest way to start a habit, and to keep it going, is to make it easy. 🚀 I wanted to streamline the process of revision as much as possible. 📖
