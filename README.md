# Random-Revision

Welcome to the repo for a simple website which gives me a random A-Level topic to revise

"But why?"

Picture this, you come home, you are all ready to learn - mentally prepared, you have everything ready, you finally sit down...and you don't know what to revise, there are so many things to choose, the paradox of choice.

You loose all motivation and start getting distracted, learning disrupted.

Hence why I made this website - in the book "Atomic Habits", the author James Clear shows that often the simplest way to start a habit, and to keep it going, is to make it easy. I wanted to streamline the process of revision as much as possible.
